 #*
 * This is the Velocity macro library used for dictionary generation.
 *
 * This library is only provided for convenience. All macros defined in this
 * file should be backed by some Java implementation.
 *#

#**
 * Default invocation of the Data Dictionary generator. The only parameters
 * you need to define are:
 *
 * sources      list of source paths for the Data Dictionary generator.
 * classes      path to the target folder where the generator will store
 *              its output
 *#
#macro(DefaultDDicGeneration $sources $classes $metadatapath)
    $dictBase.defaultDDicGeneration($sources, $classes, $metadatapath)
#end


#**
 * Create an additional database content deployable containing *_dbc.xml
 * files from declared source folders. The deployable will have the same
 * name as the default deployable, but with the suffix "+dbc.sda", e.g
 * <archive_name>.sda -> <archive_name>+dbc.sda
 *#
#macro(CreateDBContentArchive $createDeployDependency)
    $dictBase.createDBContentArchive($createDeployDependency)
#end

#**
 * Merges translation *.xlf files with the original *.dbc files. The resulting
 * *.dbc files are written to the temp folder "translation_dir". From there they
 * are collected by createDBContentArchive.
 *#
#macro(CreateDBContentTranslation)
    $dictBase.createDBContentTranslation()
