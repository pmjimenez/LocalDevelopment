 * This is the Velocity macro library used for all build plugins.
 *
 * Please consider the following points:
 *
 *   1. Please comment your macros! It's important for others who have to read
 *      and understand macros.
 *
 *   2. Using proper indentation makes it much more easy to read the macros,
 *      especially when nested conditions and iterations are used.
 *      Although this may lead to badly formatted build.xml files, it's better
 *      to have a clearly readable source. There are tools available that can
 *      reformat XML files, but not the Velocity template files.
 *
 * Thank you in advance
